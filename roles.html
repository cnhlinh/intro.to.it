  <h1>Roles</h1>
  <p>In the proposal, we did not mention specific roles of the members because the initial plan was that every member will do all the tasks together. However, after submitting the proposal, we realized that it is not a good way to get things done. Each member has their own position of strengths, so we assigned roles according to them. </p>
  <p>As we mentioned, Linh is the main writer of this final report since she did a great job with her parts in the project proposal.
     Ninh, the owner of the original idea, prepared the presentation slide. Bao is in charge of building the application’s UI. 
     Linh created the concept sketch of the Smart Pill Box. Regarding the group’s webpage, Thinh and Linh contributed the most to it.
      Creating a website from scratch is a huge task for freshmen like us; therefore, we decided to build it together.
      Additionally, all members took part in the presentation. Lastly, we also get the opportunity to learn and apply Github into this projext aswell.
    Initally, Github was very unfamiliar and for us but as time passes we realised how helped and efficient it is for us to push and pull our code 
    instead of sending it to each other through email or social media.
