  <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
  <p class="text">We took the first 2 weeks to gather members. In week 3, we decided on the idea, did any relevant 
    research, and started writing the proposal. Our project started off with a simple idea of solving 
    the medical non-adherence caused by forgetfulness by a reminder gadget. The period from week 4 to week 
    5 was the most important time of the project since we had to work on defining the scope. We did research 
    on similar products and realized that a plain pill case with reminder features is fairly common on the 
    market. Our Smart Pill Box’s features mostly come from our needs as a consumer. We tried to think 
    about: if we were the potential customers, what feature we would like to have in this product.
    Since we want to keep the case portable, we cannot integrate many features in the box.
    On the other hand, we did add more features to the mobile application<span class="dots">...</span> <span class="moreText">
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">All available smart pill cases on the market have one thing in common, it is that their goals only support its individual users, not the whole medical field. It is such a waste when the mobile app has so much potential and the data it received can be of use to medicine in general. We think of ways to utilize this data. For a piece of information to be used many times, the first stage of the process is the input stage. So, the app must be capable of collecting and capturing data. There are many types of information related to medicine use: types of medicine, dosage, times,…and other related data, for example, time of last check-up. Therefore, the next stage is the processing, which includes organizing, classifying, and summarizing. Only after these stages, the data can be stored properly and can be retrieved at any time.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">A possible scenario is that some users will think our data share system might be privacy invasion. Regarding this issue, we make sure that the application only collects and shares data related to medicine use. Whether to share these data with the medical center or not is also the patients’ choice. We do suggest users allow sharing these data as none of sensitive information will be collected. Concerning PHI (Protected Health Information), we only receive data that are inputted by the users or the associated medical center.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">While writing the proposal scope, we tried to integrate as many features as possible into the app. However, we realized that it was not a great idea to add an excessive number of features. Our targeted customers include elders, so it is also our goal to make the app as simple as possible. In addition, we realized a problem with mobile apps on the market, that is they only support a certain number of operating system versions, for example, a popular video streaming app requires IOS 15.0 or later on iPhone devices. It is our job to make the app available on as many OS versions as possible, and even on older devices, as our goal is to make the product widely accessible. However, since the app connects with the Smart Pill Box via Bluetooth, it is only available on Bluetooth supported devices.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">Since our time for this project is short and our ability and resources are limited so we cannot work on the backend of the applications. We did make an UI of the app that we will show later to present a better idea of what we have been working on and planned to do if this project had the chance to proceed to the next stage.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">The team members are greatly concerned about hygiene: therefore, we specifically focus on adding features to the Smart Pill Box that make storing the medicine last longer. The Smart Pill Box can remain a certain temperature, sterilize pills with UV lights and remove any water vapor to prevent mold. In addition, the pill box can dispense the pills on its own. This feature is made to limit direct interaction between bare hands with pills. Hand is one of the body parts with the highest volume of bacteria because it comes into contact with many objects, which means many germs, everyday.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">The Smart Pill Box grids divide pills into types, not into days or times, which also make refilling easier, just by pouring the pill directly into any grids the users want. A sensor in the case can notify users to fill up empty grids.  </p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">The out-of-scope part in the proposal basically consists of eliminated features that was initially in the scope. The medicine feedback and rating features can affect other patients’ experience with a particular type of medicine. Everyone’s bodies are different from each other’s, so a medicament might not work for one and work for others. Reading others’ reviews about a medicine can make an impact on the patients’ adherence. If they hear negative feedback on the drug, they may refuse to take it. We, the developers, and the customers are not medical professionals, so we should not evaluate pharmaceutical drugs. We are also not related to any pharmaceutical companies, hence, we are not responsible for any issues with the medicine, for example, defectiveness.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">After submitting the proposal, we start assigning roles to members. Every member seems comfortable with their roles. Bao - the most experienced member of our group - undertakes the UI design for the mobile app. He is also the most artistic member, so we entrust him with this task. Bao has put a lot of effort into learning and practicing CSS. Ninh is the member who came up with the initial idea, he also works on the project’s scope. They have been working together really well, from researching for information to finalizing all the features of both the Smart Pill Box and the mobile application.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">The trickiest part of this project to us might be all the hardware-related parts. We came up with the design of the device, but we are not sure whether the design is physically feasible. The product prototype with the actual outcome are two different things. The Smart Pill Box might look fine on the design, but when it comes to creating a real one, there will be more issues. We have to choose a suitable material, which satisfies our requirements of sustainability, safety, price. There are so many factors that may make the Smart Pill Box not be able to survive the real-world test which are not under control of us software developers. Therefore, in order to take this project to the manufacturing stage, the team will need specialized engineers that can take over hardware work. For now, the best we can do is create a concept sketch to present what we have in mind for the final product. The credit of the sketch goes to our talented member, Linh!<p1 class ="text"></p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">From week 6, we mainly focus on practicing by ourselves. Before week 8, there was not any significant development in the group project. Despite that, we still took the time seriously and made a huge improvement in our skills and knowledge, especially in HTML and CSS. According to the initial plan, during week 9, we will build a 3D model of the Smart Pill Box. However, creating a 3D model is much more complicated than we thought it would be. It would consume a lot of time so we moved on with other things and created a sketch instead. Additionally, we made a mistake with the timetable, we did not include building the group’s webpage in the plan. So during week 9 and 10 - the time in which we were supposed to create a 3D model, Thinh and Linh worked together to make the website.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1 class ="text">Linh is the main writer of the final report and in charge of assigning roles to members and managing work progress. Ninh prepared presentation slides. We finished everything before week 11 to avoid overlapping with other tests or deadlines. In week 11, we did the presentation when we found some flaws in our project. The concept sketch lacked explanation of how the inside works, so Linh added that to the report and the group webpage.</p1>
