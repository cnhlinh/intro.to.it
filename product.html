      <p>Our project are currently in the very <b>early stage</b>, so we aren't able to create an actual model of what the project look like. So had to sketch it digitally
        so that you can have a better understanding and visualisation of what it looks like. As you can see to your right, there are three different sketches of what
        the product looks like.

      <p>As you can see with the sketch here, this view is like a transparent text which allow you to see how the pill can be dispense to the correct hole. As you can see that
        inside the pill-box there are slides which allows the pills to slide to the hole when the time for patient to take the medication. The reason for this feature is that
        patient do not have to touch the pill, as you can put a glass at the hole so that the pill can fall it which prevents you from touching the pill directly.
