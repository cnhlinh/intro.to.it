  <h1>Aims</h1>
  <p>The aim of our project is to create a system that reminds users to take pills. Our system contains a device called Smart Pill Box and an application. Our smart pill box stores and dispenses, is connected to a mobile app which stores prescriptions and keeps track of what and how many medicines they have used in the past. The statistic will be sent to the hospital so the doctors and nurses can coordinate with this device to enhance the patient’s adherence.
    The pill box organizes pills by type, which help the user refill with no hassle, just by pouring them in any grid of your choice. This also limits direct hand interaction with the pills and reduces the chances of transmitting any germs from users’ hands to the pills. Inside the box, there are sanitization components that are capable of keeping medicine at the right temperature, sterilizing with UV lights, and sustaining dryness. When it is time to take medicine, the box will flash, beep, or vibrate, depending on the setting. The box can also dispense the pills itself, so the users do not have to touch them to get them out. 
    The Smart Pill Box and the mobile app are connected via Bluetooth.

   <p>
    The app can be seen as the “brain” of the pill box since it controls all the activity. It “reads” the prescription and automatically sets up reminders, sends and receives signals from the pill box. Apart from the notification from the pill case, the users will also receive notification from their phones. 
    The record feature is similar to a health journal as all data including diseases, medications use, and appointment history are stored for future use. This data can also be shared with medical centers so doctors and nurses can collaborate to avoid patients’ non-adherence. Medical non-adherence significantly affects progression of diseases, this is the reason why if doctors know the patients’ medicine use, they can analyze all the factors contributing to the current health state and check-ups will be much more pleasant. 
    Finally, we work hard on making this a widely accessible product.  
   </p> 
   <p>There is no limit in our targeted market. We want the Smart Pill Box to be a daily device to all people of all age groups, genders, and social classes. We see no benefit from making this device a privilege to people of the upper class. Therefore, a well-designed, easy-to-navigate app is a must, together with that, the Smart Pill Box has to be easy to use. We also plan on making many versions of the pill box of different price ranges to accommodate people's needs and budgets.
    The outcomes we expected to see from the products being used is decrease in unintentional non-adherence cases, so the most important part of the final products is the reminder features. If the times and resources are limited, we will prioritize developing this feature.</p>
