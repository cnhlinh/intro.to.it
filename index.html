  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p class="text">
    The idea of this project slightly leaned towards the medicine field, and we focused on solving the 
    medication non-adherence problem. The initial idea was not to create a brand-new innovation but upgrade 
    an everyday object that can make revolutionary changes in daily life. It is common knowledge that medication
     nonadherence is a costly problem as it poses an impact on health care cost. For a certain disease, 
     it might even be fatal. We came up with a device called “Smart Pill Box”, which we believe can make 
     bigger impacts than it seems.<span class="dots">...</span> <span class="moreText">

      <p1 class ="text">The first thing we expect to see from the outcome of this project is medical non-adherence being reduced. It is common knowledge that medication nonadherence is a costly problem as it poses an impact on health care cost. According to [1], non-adherence was associated with 50.2% higher total health care costs, including hospital admissions, outpatient visits, emergency, and patients with compliance need to pay 12.5% lower medication cost than patients who do not correctly follow the medical advice. In another research, in 62% of unintentional non-adherence cases, patients came up with forgetfulness as explanation, 37% and 23% were due to running out of medicine and carelessness respectively [2]. Patients who do not refill their medicine may have financial difficulties, however for most chronic conditions, generic medications are available at reasonable prices [3]. However, as stated in [4], using low-cost reminder devices, such as pill bottle strip with toggles, digital timer cap, or standard pillbox does not show any significant improvement in non-adherence. That’s why we came up with the idea of taking these gadgets to a next level.</p1>
      <br>
      <p1 class ="text">Our main motivation for the project is the fact that we are also non-adherence with medication. We approach the problem as someone who also experiences it, so the feasibility of the solution we propose is undoubted. As IT students, all group members believe that technology is supposed to assist us with daily essentials, and taking medication is one of them. We start with small but vital projects today and bigger projects, bigger ideas in the future.</p1>
      <br>
      <p1 class ="text">In recent years, we have seen the dramatic growth of IoT (Internet of Things) in lots of areas, which has raised the living standard. Our devices will not only be an important component in digitized healthcare systems but also provide assistance to people. Throughout this project, we develop essential soft skills for working on an IT project, especially a group project. The outcome also shows our ability to utilize knowledge and apply them to an everyday gadget.</p1>
      <br>
      <p1 class ="text">On the market, there are some similar products to ours. They are all smart pill cases with reminder feature. The most popular one is the EllieGrid. The main difference between these cases and ours are that ours is capable of sanitizing and dispensing. The data stored and collected from our application can also be used for many purposes, for example, research. It also helps patients keep track of past medical history which may be useful for patients in certain cases.</p1>
