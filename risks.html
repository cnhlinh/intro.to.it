  <h1>Risks</h1>
  <h2>1. Limitability of skills:</h2>
  <p>Since all members are freshman majoring in Information Technology, we do not have much experience in crafting an object with technology integrated in. Therefore, we are planning to have consultation with some software engineer experts to decide if we need to collaborate with someone specialized in this field.</p>
  <h2>2. Security Risks:</h2>
  <p>Members are required to keep this project confidential. However, a major number of documents about Smart Pill Box are stored on Internet hosting services such as Google Drive and GitHub which have potential information leakage. Unfortunately, this is inevitable. </p>
  <h2>3. Technical Risks:</h2>
  <p>There are many applications and software that we are not familiar with, for example, Adobe Dimension, which is the software we have chosen to do 3D rendering for the final product. This software turned out to be hard to work with and it would take us lots of time to build the 3D model. We changed the plan and created a concept sketch instead.  Up until now, there has been no problem with our personal computer, they are still working perfectly. But there’s every likelihood of them breaking down suddenly. In that case, we will use on-campus PCs while waiting for them to be fixed.</p>
  <h2>4. Cost risks:</h2>
  <p>Since all members are IT-majored, we have limited to no experience in doing business-related stuff, which involves forecasting the cost of manufacturing and the need to outsource to contractors. Some external cost risk might be changes in prices of material and shipping (due to some global issues affecting gas price). We are planning to work with other departments to do budget planning and mitigate cost risks.</p>
  <h2>5. Schedule risks:</h2>
  <p>When something unpredictable happens, they may delay upcoming tasks in the timetable and might require some adjustment. Every problem will lead to things not going according to schedule. Eventually, it will result in inadequate time allocated for each stage. If one problem is not handled carefully, it can have a direct effect on the whole process. While we were planning out the schedule, we also assessed risks associated with each task to consider increasing that activity’s duration if they are likely to consume more time than we had expected. </p>
  <p>In the schedule we proposed, we did not include building the website.  In week 10, we managed to set some time aside for that even though our schedule was quite packed. We tried to finish the sketch and the app’s UI as soon as possible to have time for that.</p>
