  <h1>Group processes and Communication</h1>
  <p>The key point leading to the success of a project is effective communication, the members need to have thorough conversation to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoid any misunderstanding. At first, we mainly relied on face-to-face meetings, but there were some issues that made this meeting hard to conduct. We only have 2 members living near the campus, the others live far from the campus, so we are not always available on campus at the same time. That’s why we start to have more online meetings through Microsoft Teams or Facebook Messenger for small discussion. We also put down our primary ideas and scratch in Google Docs so everyone can all see and write down opinions and comments. This way has been easier for everyone as they can be more flexible with the schedule.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, it is obvious that messaging and online meetings can not replace in-person meetings, we still try to meet up on campus as much as possible. We make the most of the spare time between classes to join with each other working on the project. We expect everyone to show up to the meet-up at least three times a week, the members don’t need to be presented at every online meeting, although the frequency of every two days is recommended. Regarding email and messages, responding within 4 hours during working time is required. However, it was not as productive as we expected since in most of the meetings, either online or face-to-face, there would be a member who could not attend or had to leave early. Sometimes some members are slow on checking the group’s messages.     
  </p>
  <p>If a member in the group doesn’t show up at required meetings and respond to email/ messages for too long, we will proceed with everything without their confirmation to keep up with the timetable. In case a member ignores the group’s rules for many times without providing a valid reason for their absence or being unresponsive, they will be assigned more tasks. If worse, one may be eliminated from the project. Luckily, we did not have to come to that decision. All members still maintained stable work progress until week 12. </p>
