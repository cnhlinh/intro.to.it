      <p>The main reason why I chose this topic alongside other members is because I believe and think that a simple product like a “Smart Pill Box”, can be very efficient, effective and very easily to be widely used and well known towards the medical industry globally. As not only that, this product has the potential to majorly decrease the death rate globally due to the amount of people forgetting to take their medications, could be on accident or due to a special medical condition that they have which limits what they can and cannot remember. Not just patients, but doctors can also benefit from this as now they do not need to remind their patient to take their medicine through a phone call or a regular medical-checkup. But instead, they can set up an alarm on the Smart Pill Box, so that it can alert the patients to take their medication during whatever time that it was set to. </p>
      <p>With my own experience, I already have some basic background towards the Information Technology subject as a whole and the main reason I chose to pursue this as my major in University is simply because I want to understand more about the industry and want to know why certain works or not work. 
        I am hooked by the nature of the IT industry and the 
        endless potential that it has, you can me mail me at. <a href="mailto:s3977756@rmit.edu.vn">s3977756@rmit.edu.vn</a></p>

      <h2>Bao</h2>
      <p>I am Bao Duong and my ID is s3987239. The reason why I am fascinated in this topic is because it can strengthen my critical thinking significantly. 
        First of all, I chose IT randomly because at that time, I did not know what I am good at, therefore, I chose IT to be the base of my journey discovering
         what I am good at. As a matter of fact I do not have much knowledge related to this topic, however, in my opinion, I do believe that this 
         project could enhance my basic knowledge towards this topic. My role in the project is to research different resources to illustrate the function, features and
          the application of this project along with Ninh. Currently, I have been studying Computer Science for 3 years, so I think I have a little bit of knowledge in 
          this field, you can contact me at: <a href="mailto:s3987239@rmit.edu.vn">s3987239@rmit.edu.vn</a></p>

      <h2>Ninh</h2>
      <p>My name is Pho An Ninh, I consider myself the most dynamic and beautiful group member. I am very honored that the team members chose my pill box idea. The reason why I came up with this idea comes from my real-life experience. 
        I often have to take so many different medicines, sometimes I can't remember which one I have to take. So this will be a practical product that solves the complicated 
        problems related to taking pills, helps users control the drugs they take, and reduces anxiety for busy people. Talking about this project, I believe that this is a 
        practical project that is useful for the development of mankind, helping humanity reach new developments in life,

      <h2>Linh</h2>
      <p>My name is Cao Nguyen Hai Linh and my student number is s3978387. One of the main reasons why I’m intrigued by this project is because I believe that the smart pill box could be a tremendous help to my daily life. As a person having to take medicine and supplements regularly, this device would save me lots of time. As I always forget to take those medication times, and I do believe that many others have the same issue. For elder people who have impairment of memory, it can be difficult to remember what pills to take, how many pills to take and when to take them. I may not have a lot of experience overall but I’m willing to learn more skills in order to meet the expectations to be a crucial part of this project as a member. </p>
      <p>As of now, I am dedicated to improving my coding skill but also work on different aspects such as designing and developing an application. Furthermore, being given the opportunity to take part in this project is truly an honorable experience to get since I get the opportunity to submerge myself in a variety of fields that Information Technology is involved in. </p>
      <p>The field that I am currently aiming to focus on is Artificial Intelligence, which also leads to my desired career - an AI engineer. AI is still new in Vietnam in comparison to other countries, however, I believe that there will be a breakthrough in this field soon, in just the next few years.
        I also want to achieve higher education in the field 
        after I graduate and gain some experience with jobs, you can mail me at.<a href ="mailto:s3978387@rmit.edu.vn">s3978387@rmit.edu.vn</a></p>
