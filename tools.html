  <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
  <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">The application that we used for the concept sketch is Adobe Illustrator Version 3.0.1. We used it on an iPad together with an Apple Pencil to visualize what 
    we have in mind for the Smart Pill Box. This is a free application, but it provides us everything we needed for the concept sketch. Linh has some prior experience 
    with Adobe Illustrator on desktop with the proposalâ€™s title page and table of content, so she catches on with the iPad version quite fast.
    </p>
       <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">To code our website we used Visual Studio Code as our main Integrated Development Environment, we also used CSS to create different styles for our HTML page.
        We also used a bit of javascript to add some additional features for our home page which you can see. Since the website was worked
        collaboratively by Linh and Thinh, we used Github as method to do this. Thinh is the host of the Github repository, so he pushes the first
        design up on to Github. Linh then pull the code down to code it on her device locally. When Linh pushes her code in, she created a new
        branch, as this prevents the work to get on conflict. Then finally, Thinh will pull Linh's code down then merge the two code locally if there
        are no conflict within the code.
