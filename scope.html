  <h1>Scope</h1>
  <p>
    Initially, our team created a very detailed project scope. We divided the project into 2 main parts to complete. The first part is making the pill box, and the second part is creating the mobile app. However, our team encountered many limitations that caused the original plan to change. As for the making of the pill box, because this is a student project, we don't have the investors, equipment, and technology to make a pill box like in the idea. Instead, we did a sketch of the box because it is not time-consuming and easy to demonstrate to others. Regarding making a mobile app, we have finished designing the user interface (UI) and have completed almost all the planned features.  Although we have encountered many limits during our process, we came up with a solution that is to complete the features with higher priority first and then split the time to do lower priority tasks. This allowed our team to quickly create a new scope and get the job done smoothly.

  <p>
    There are two main limits we have faced. The first one is we are newbies and inexperienced which means that we have never had experience in working with university projects before. We have to adapt to new procedures, asking for senior students and consulting with tutors to understand more about the working process. Second, we have very little time to complete the scopes that the team has given. At first, our group's ambitions were huge. We wanted to complete a project that required too many resources, time, and effort to research. During the working process, realizing that there was a shortage of time, we shortened the work and changed the plan to complete the project on time, while still ensuring the completion of the product prototype.
